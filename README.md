### Projectile game
A simple physics guessing game which the user aims a projectile onto a target. The target screen is shown for a few seconds followed by a prompt to input the energy in J. Depending on the level, the user may be able to adjust the mass and angle of the projectile as well. The user gets three attempts to correctly land the projectile on the target. There are three stages in levels one and two and level three is endless.
